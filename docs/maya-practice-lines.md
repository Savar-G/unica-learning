# Maya practice lines awaiting approval

Status: pending Savar. Launch approval is pending.

The base is PR #402 at c188e617c314561796003d6c483c0eeda1b11926. All 578 existing bank and template wordings stay unchanged. The new set has 43 wordings: 38 replies and 5 carry explanations.

Before this change, failed free talk used a neutral reply, such as "Thanks for telling me." A carry hint could name "the 1 you carried" before the child knew where it came from. These new ids have no old line to replace. The table lists every new wording. Values in braces come from the checked question package.

For 27 + 39, the first carry wording is: "7 + 9 = 16. 16 is 1 ten and 6 ones. Write 6 in the ones. Carry 1 ten to the tens." It does not say 66.

The saved WIP proposed D-204 for these corrections. PR #409 uses D-204 for fractions. This proposal has no decision number. It does not change the accepted D-202 record.

## Acknowledgement phrases (#532)

Status: pending Savar. Added after the set above, and outside it: the voice worker says these, not the controller. Each is code-written and passes the gate check in `src/lib/maya-voice-ack.test.ts`. "Mm-hm" and "Okay" are left out because they can sound like "yes" after "Is it 56?". Say if you want "Mm-hm" back: it is warmer, and the risk is the false "yes".

| Id | Line |
|---|---|
| `ack.think.hmm` | Hmm, let me think. |
| `ack.see.plain` | Let me see. |
| `ack.moment.plain` | Just a moment. |
| `ack.thinking.plain` | I'm thinking. |
| `ack.think.this` | Let me think about this. |
| `ack.see.hmm` | Hmm, let me see. |
| `ack.think.plain` | Let me think. |
| `ack.moment.hmm` | Hmm, just a moment. |
| `ack.thinking.hmm` | Hmm, I'm thinking. |
| `ack.see.here` | Let me see here. |

For your reading: "I'm thinking." is a claim about an AI (D-197 forbids untrue claims about Maya); it is kept as an everyday way to say "wait". A child who says something hard can hear one of these before Maya's safety line, because the model has not read the child's words yet.
